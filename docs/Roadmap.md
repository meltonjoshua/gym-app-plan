#### **Week 5-6: User Profile & Analytics APIs**
```typescript
// MISSING: backend/src/routes/userRoutes.ts (currently empty)
// MISSING: backend/src/routes/analyticsRoutes.ts (currently empty)
// MISSING: backend/src/controllers/userController.ts
// MISSING: backend/src/controllers/analyticsController.ts
```
**Required Endpoints**:
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/users/profile` - Get user profile
- [ ] `PUT /api/v1/users/profile` - Update profile
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/analytics/progress` - Get progress data
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/analytics/insights` - Get AI insights

#### **Week 7-8: Integration & Testing**

---

## 📊 **REALISTIC PROJECT STATUS**

### **✅ What's Actually Working (Verified)**
1. **Mobile App Frontend** - 100% complete and functional
2. **Authentication Backend** - Full working authentication system
3. **Marketing Website** - Professional site deployed and live
4. **Production Infrastructure** - Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD ready
5. **User Interface** - 50+ screens with real functionality

### **🚫 What's Missing (Critical Gaps)**
1. **Core Backend APIs** - Workout, nutrition, social APIs are placeholder files
2. **Data Persistence** - No real data storage for app features
3. **Real AI Features** - Currently mock responses only
4. **Payment Processing** - Configuration exists but not implemented

### **🎯 Immediate Action Required**
**The app cannot function without the backend APIs.** While the frontend is production-ready, users cannot save workouts, track nutrition, or use social features because the backend endpoints return empty responses.

**Priority Order**:
1. 🔥 **URGENT**: Implement backend APIs for core features
2. 🔥 **HIGH**: Connect frontend to real APIs
3. 🔧 **MEDIUM**: Implement real AI features
4. 💰 **LOW**: Complete payment integration

This roadmap now accurately reflects the true state of the project: excellent frontend implementation with critical backend gaps that must be addressed for a functional application.
