2. ✅ `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Complete production stack orchestration  
3. ✅ `k8s/deployment.yaml` - Kubernetes deployment with auto-scaling
4. ✅ `k8s/service.yaml` - Kubernetes services and ingress configuration
5. ✅ `k8s/storage.yaml` - Persistent storage and volume configuration
6. ✅ `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Complete CI/CD pipeline with security scanning
7. ✅ `backend/src/config/production.ts` - Comprehensive production configuration
8. ✅ `scripts/deploy.sh` - Automated deployment script with smoke testing
9. ✅ `scripts/smoke-tests.sh` - Production smoke testing and health checks

## 🏗️ **Production Infrastructure Features:**

### **Docker Production Stack:**
