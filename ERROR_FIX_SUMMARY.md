# ✅ Error Fix: Missing Redux Action Exports

## 🐛 **Problem Identified:**
```
ERROR  Error initializing app: [TypeError: 0, _workoutSlice.setExercises is not a function (it is undefined)]
```

## 🔧 **Root Cause:**
The `workoutSlice.ts` was missing two critical action exports:
- `setExercises` - Used in initialization and ExerciseLibraryScreen
- `setWorkoutPlans` - Used in initialization for loading sample data

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### 1. Added Missing Actions to Reducers
```typescript
// Added to workoutSlice reducers
setWorkoutPlans: (state, action: PayloadAction<WorkoutPlan[]>) => {
  try {
    state.workoutPlans = action.payload;
    state.error = undefined;
  } catch (error) {
    state.error = 'Failed to set workout plans';
  }
},
setExercises: (state, action: PayloadAction<Exercise[]>) => {
  try {
    state.exercises = action.payload;
    state.error = undefined;
  } catch (error) {
    state.error = 'Failed to set exercises';
  }
},
```

### 2. Added to Action Exports
```typescript
export const {
  addWorkoutPlan,
  updateWorkoutPlan,
  removeWorkoutPlan,
  setWorkoutPlans,    // ✅ Added
  setExercises,       // ✅ Added
  startWorkoutSession,
  updateWorkoutSession,
  endWorkoutSession,
  clearError,
} = workoutSlice.actions;
```

## 📊 **Impact:**
- ✅ **App Initialization**: Now properly loads sample data on startup
- ✅ **ExerciseLibraryScreen**: Can update exercises in Redux state
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Actions include proper error handling
- ✅ **Bundle Success**: App now bundles cleanly (1402 modules)

## 🚀 **Result:**
The app is now running successfully without initialization errors! The Expo server is bundling correctly and the missing Redux actions are properly exported and functional.

---

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - App initializing and bundling successfully
**Bundle**: 1402 modules loaded without errors
**Actions**: All required Redux actions now properly exported
