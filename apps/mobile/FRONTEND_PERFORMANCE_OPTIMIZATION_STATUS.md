  averageRenderTime: number,
  memoryUsage: MemoryInfo,
  slowComponents: string[]
}
```

```typescript
// Smart memoization
const OptimizedComponent = memo(Component, shallowEqual);

// Efficient list rendering
<OptimizedList
  data={items}
  estimatedItemSize={80}
  windowSize={10}
  maxItemsToRender={50}
/>

// Debounced state updates
const debouncedValue = useDebouncedValue(searchTerm, 300);
```

### Caching Architecture
```typescript
// Multi-layer caching
Level 1: Component memoization
Level 2: Selector memoization  
Level 3: Redux state caching
Level 4: Persistent storage
```
